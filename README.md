# FizzBuzz Kata

Write a program that takes a number as argument, and it returns the number as string, but it has 3 special cases: 

* If the number is divisible by **3** return the word “`Fizz`”
* If the number is divisible by **5** return the word “`Buzz`”
* If the number is divisible by **3 and 5** return the word “`FizzBuzz`”

Example results:
```
1 >> 1
2 >> 2
3 >> Fizz
4 >> 4
5 >> Buzz
6 >> Fizz
7 >> 7
8 >> 8
9 >> Fizz
10 >> Buzz
11 >> 11
12 >> Fizz
13 >> 13
14 >> 14
15 >> FizzBuzz
16 >> 16
17 >> 17
18 >> Fizz
19 >> 19
20 >> Buzz
